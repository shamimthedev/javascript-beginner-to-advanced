Map
  - The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
  - Doesn't modify the original array, instead gives a new array. 

  let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5]

  let double = numbers.map(num => num * 2)
  console.log(double)
