Filter
  - The filter() method is a built-in array method in JavaScript that allows you to create a new array containing elements that pass a certain condition. It provides a clean and concise way to filter out elements from an array based on a specified criteria. 

  const songs = [
    {
      name: 'Lucky You', duration: 4.34
    },
    {
      name: 'Just Like You', duration: 3.23
    },
    {
      name: 'The Search', duration: 2.33
    },
    {
      name: 'Old Town Road', duration: 1.43
    },
    {
      name: 'The Box', duration: 5.23
    },
  ]

  const res = songs.filter(song => song.duration > 3)
  console.log(res)
