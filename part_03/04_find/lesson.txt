Find
  - The find() method is another built-in array helper in JavaScript that allows you to find the first element in an array that matches a specific condition. It returns the value of the first element that satisfies the given testing function, or undefined if no element in found. 

  const friends = [
    {name: 'Mizu', age: 20},
    {name: 'Del', age: 25},
    {name: 'Ron', age: 18},
    {name: 'Mizu', age: 30},
  ]

  const res = friends.find(friend => friend.name === 'Mizu)
  console.log(res)
