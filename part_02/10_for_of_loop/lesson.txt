For...of Loop
  - The for...of loop in JavaScript is a modern iteration statement introduced in ES6 that provides a concise and easy way to loop over elements in iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more. It allows you to iterate directly over the values of the elements, rather than dealing with their indices or keys, which makes the code more readable and less error-prone.
  - for (variable of iterable) {...}

  let text = 'Shamim'

  for (const char of text){
    console.log(char)
  }
