For...in Loop
  - the for...in loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object. It is a way to loop through the keys (property names) of an object.
  - for (let key in object) {...}

  let person = {
    name: 'Mizu',
    age: 25,
    gender: 'male'
  }

  for (let keys in person){
    console.log(keys, person[keys])
  }

  2. let list = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']

  for (let index in list){
    console.log(`${index}: ${list[index]}`)
  }
