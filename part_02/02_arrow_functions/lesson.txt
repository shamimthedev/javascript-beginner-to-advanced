Arrow Functions
    - Also known as fat arrow functions, are a concise and shorter way to define functions in JavaScript. They were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provide a more compact syntax compared to traditional function expressions. 

        function greet(name){
            return `Hello ${name}`
        }

        console.log(greet('Md.'))

        Making it a arrow function: 
            1. greet = (name) => {
                return `Hello ${name}`
            }

            2. greet = name => `Hello ${name}`   
                // for one parameter, can ommit the (), return keyword and {}.

            3. const greet = name => `Hello ${name}`
            4. const greet = ()=> `Hello ${name}`
                // when there is no parameter
